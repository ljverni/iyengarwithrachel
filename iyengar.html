            Iyengar Yoga is a unique and rigorous form of Hatha Yoga, pioneered by B.K.S. Iyengar, that emphasizes the alignment of the body, precision in postures, and the use of props like blocks, belts, and blankets to help individuals of all abilities and backgrounds. The method’s attention to detail ensures that each pose is practiced safely and effectively, allowing practitioners to experience yoga’s full benefits.<br><br>
            Developed in India in the 20th century, Iyengar Yoga is deeply rooted in the ancient yoga philosophy, with an emphasis on mindfulness, breath awareness, and the spiritual and mental benefits of the practice. Over the years, it has evolved into a global movement, inspiring millions to experience the transformative power of yoga.<br><br>
            One of the most notable features of Iyengar Yoga is the extensive use of props, which makes it accessible to people of all ages and fitness levels. Whether you are new to yoga or a seasoned practitioner, the use of props helps to deepen understanding of poses and provides stability, alignment, and support.<br><br>
            Today, Iyengar Yoga is practiced worldwide in studios, gyms, and homes, and continues to be a living tradition, constantly evolving while remaining grounded in the timeless teachings of B.K.S. Iyengar.
