          <!-- <h2>Welcome to Iyengar Yoga with Rachel</h2> -->
          <p>
            Rachel is originally from London, and enjoyed a successful career in the fast-moving, dynamic world of media. She worked within a high profile advertising agency before moving into television production at the BBC.  
            She now works as a Paediatric Occupational Therapist within the NHS.<br><br>
            She came to yoga during her first pregnancy, over 20 years ago, trying a variety of practices before finding an affinity with the Iyengar method.  She continued this when she moved to Newcastle, becoming an active 
            member of the North East Iyengar Yoga community.
