            I’m a certified Iyengar yoga teacher running relaxed and friendly weekly classes in the Jesmond area of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br><br>
            My classes welcome everyone from the complete beginner to those practicing regularly; I am committed to making Iyengar yoga accessible and inclusive, ensuring that everyone can participate and benefit from regular  yoga practice to feel stronger and more flexible with improved posture, balance and overall well being. Yoga is a truly holistic approach to health as the poses (asanas) incorporate and unite both the mind and body in movement.<br><br>
            Iyengar teachers undergo rigorous and intense training over a five year period which incorporates practical and written exams in anatomy, first aid, yoga philosophy and teaching theory. Once qualified we have to undertake continuous professional development and personal yoga practice in order to maintain our licence to teach.  This intense level of training ensures as teachers, we can adapt poses for differing levels of ability, age and health conditions to meet the needs of individuals attending the class where everyone is encouraged to work at their own pace.
