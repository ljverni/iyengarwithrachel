            <p>'I love Rachel’s Friday class! I’m a yoga 🧘‍♀️ novice and she explains each position brilliantly, she’s very knowledgeable. I feel the benefits in posture & balance already and start the weekend feeling relaxed and calm (although that doesn’t last long!)'</p>

            <p>'I’ve been taking classes with Rachel for a few years, and honestly, she’s amazing. She pays attention to your alignment, makes sure you’re comfortable, and always encourages you to go at your own pace. And she’s not just a great teacher, but also a genuinely lovely person. You can’t go wrong with her!'</p>
