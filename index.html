          <h2>Rachel Johnson</h2>
          <p>
            I’m a certified Iyengar Yoga teacher running relaxed and friendly classes in Jesmond.  All levels welcome.<br><br>
            For those unfamiliar with Iyengar yoga, it is a safe form of yoga which offers the opportunity for improved flexibility, strength and balance, better overall physical health and well being.  When practiced regularly you really will notice improvement in all these areas.<br><br>
            I hold a Level 1 Iyengar yoga certification, having qualified in the summer of 2018 after practicing yoga for 16 years.  All teachers have to complete Iyengar yoga training which is intense and robust, ensuring as teachers we can adapt the poses for all levels and assist in adjusting those with physical challenges.
