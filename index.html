          <h2>Welcome to Iyengar Yoga with Rachel</h2>
          <p>
            Rachel qualified as an Iyengar Yoga teacher in 2018, under the guidance of Margaret Austin, one of the UK’s most senior teachers.<br><br>
            She regularly teaches mixed ability classes in her local community, and for a housing charity, where she offers classes for staff, as well as adapted classes for older adults.
            She is committed to making Iyengar yoga accessible and inclusive, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to participate and benefit. She also volunteers on the Iyengar Yoga UK Events and North East England Iyengar Yoga Committees, as a way of giving back to the Iyengar community which has enriched her life for the last 20 years.<br><br>
            As well as holding regular classes of her own, Rachel attends classes, conventions and workshops to continue her own learning, and develop professionally from the teachings of senior, local and international Iyengar Yoga teachers. She has recently returned from an extended stay at the Iyengar Yoga Institute in Pune, India (RIMYI) where she had the privilege of studying under the guidance of the Iyengar family, observing and participating in a diverse range of classes.
